and Dr. Greg Characklis (charack@email.unc.edu)</p>
<p><strong>Class Room:</strong> McGavran-Greenberg 1302</p>
<p><strong>Class Time:</strong> Fridays, 10:10-11:25 AM, Eastern
time</p>
<p><strong>Office Hours:</strong> TBD</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None (although ENVR 755 is a
suggested co-requisite, see “Course Objectives”)</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> None. We will draw from a variety of free,
online resources.</p>
<p><strong>Software and Hardware:</strong> All software used for this
course is freely available (e.g., Python, Jupyter Notebooks). We will
walk through the installations in the first week of class. Due to the
nature of this course, all students should have access to a computer on
which they can install and run software. <em>However, if you do not have
access to a computer, or if you are unsure whether your device can be
used for programming (e.g., a tablet), please email us so we can work to
find a solution.</em></p>
<p><strong>Syllabus Changes:</strong> This syllabus (especially the
schedule) is subject to change. Students should refer to the version on
Sakai, which will be kept up to date.</p>
<h2 id="course-motivation">Course Motivation</h2>
<p>Computer programming is an increasingly important tool for
researchers interested in environmental science, engineering, and public
health. Recent examples from UNC include <a

the effect of drought on electricity production</a>, <a

and community water/sewer service</a> or between <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12940-017-0308-3">fecal
indicator bacteria and illness in swimmers</a>. The ability to formulate
research questions, build models, analyze data, and visualize results
using computer programming is a valuable toolkit for researchers in
academia, government, NGOs, and industry.</p>
<h2 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>
<p>This course will serve as an introduction to computer programming in
Python. Students will develop a working knowledge of the Python
programming language and learn how to formulate research questions as
computer code. They will learn about a variety of Python-based packages
and techniques that can be used to build models, analyze data, and
create visualizations for research in environmental sciences and
engineering.</p>
<p>ENVR 890-010 is a companion course to ENVR 755 (Analysis of Water
Resource Systems), and some lectures will place an emphasis on
applications related to water resources engineering, economics, and
management. Students are encouraged to co-enroll in ENVR 755 for context
on these applications. However, all are welcome, and many of the tools
and techniques learned in this class will be applicable to a variety of
research areas beyond water resources management.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-approach">Expectations &amp; Approach</h2>
<p>This class is intended for students with little or no experience with
programming, so we will start at the beginning. However, there will be a
fairly steep learning curve, and students will be expected to spend time
outside of class practicing and developing programming scripts to
complete assignments. Learning a programming language is much like
learning any other language - practice and repetition are key.</p>
<p>There will be short homework assignments approximately every other
week, meant to gauge understanding and reinforce techniques learned in
class. In-class time will be split between lectures, individual
exercises, and group work. Students are encouraged to actively
participate in class discussions and exercises, and ask questions.
Computer programming concepts can take a while to sink in, and if you
are confused, chances are high that others are too!</p>
<p>Grading will be based on quality of assigned work (50%) and in-class
participation (50%). Assignments will be posted on the Sakai site and
should be submitted by the due date.</p>
<h2 id="honor-policy">Honor Policy</h2>
<p>Students are encouraged to communicate and help one another with the
assignments. However, each student is responsible for completing their
own work, and plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students are also
encouraged to consult online resources (Google, Stack Exchange/Overflow,
programming blogs, etc.) - learning to ask the right questions and find
answers on the internet is a key skill for computer programmers.
However, if you copy any code directly from the internet, please cite
your source.</p>
<p>For more details, see the <a
href="https://studentconduct.unc.edu/honor-system">UNC Honor System</a>,
the <a href="https://guides.lib.unc.edu/plagiarism">UNC Libraries’
plagiarism tutorial</a>, or just ask us directly about expectations for
the class.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion">Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion</h2>
<p>Diversity of backgrounds and perspectives is vital as we strive for
equitable institutions (race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality,
age, ability, socioeconomic status, etc.). The diversity of researchers
in academia, government, NGOs, and industry affects the voices we
consider, the questions we ask, and the answers we find. <a
href="https://diverseeducation.com/article/166456/">Environmental
science</a>, <a
href="https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/">computer
science</a>, and STEM more broadly, have a long way to go on this front.
However, changes in recruiting, pedagogy, and work environment can help
to encourage students of diverse backgrounds to pursue fields such as <a
href="https://therevelator.org/colleges-minority-students-environment/">environmental
science</a> and <a
href="https://www.inc.com/kimberly-weisul/how-harvey-mudd-college-achieved-gender-parity-computer-science-engineering-physics.html">computer
science</a>. It is our intention to create a classroom in which all
students feel respected, valued, and encouraged to apply the material to
their own interests. Please let us know of any ways to make the course
more welcoming and effective for you personally or for other students or
student groups.</p>
<h2 id="community-standards-in-our-course-and-mask-use.">Community
Standards in Our Course and Mask Use.</h2>
<p>As of March 2022, masks are no longer required indoors. UNC and the
Gillings School encourage use of masks in classrooms, and if you do not
feel well please stay home. We can find ways to accommodate necessary
absences, whether via Zoom or recorded lectures. For additional
information on UNC’s COVID-19 policies and updates, see <a

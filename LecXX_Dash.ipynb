    "In this lecture we will learn about the **[Python package Dash, by plotly](https://dash.gallery/Portal/)**, which can be used to create interactive - you guessed it - dashboards with user data. There are two major parts to a Dash app (what I will call a dashboard henceforth for brevity): the layout and callbacks, which make the dashboard interactive. In this lecture, we go through installation and creation of a full sample dashboard. "

    "1. **pip install jupyter-dash** (if using Jupyter Notebooks) \n",
    "1. **pip install dash** (if you are using Spyder, Visual Studios, or another Python code editor)\n",

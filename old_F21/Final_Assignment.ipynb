    "# Homework 8: Final Assignment\n",
    "ENVR 890-010: Python for Environmental Research, Fall 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "By Rosa Cuppari. Some material adapted from Andrew Hamilton, Greg Characklis, David Gorelick and H.B. Zeff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Congratulations! \n",
    "By now, you all have learned everything from the basic to the more complex in Python. Hopefully you have also been convinced that Python can be useful, and can apply your newfound skills to any of your research or future work. To reinforce your journey in Python, we would like to see you combine all of your skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be asked to take a dataset of your choice and undertake a longer analysis than you have in your previous homework and in Spyder, instead of Jupyter Notebook. While many of the tasks we ask you to do are things you have already done in previous assignments, we would ask that you either do something new (e.g., a different regression, a new type of plot), or use a different dataset. In your submission include your code and a word document with a short description of the data, a summary of any interesting findings or relationships, and your plots (~1 page, plus plots). \n",
    "\n",
    "As an optional bonus, you are welcome to create a GitHub repository to hold your code and results. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that this final assignment can be a useful showcase for you to exhibit your coding skills in the future! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required elements:  \n",
    "- 4+ plots. At least one must show what your raw data looks like (pre-analysis) as a means to explore the dataset, and at least one must visualize your results in some way. Be sure to include labels and legends in your plots, and make tick marks legible.\n",
    "- Either a for loop or a defined function to aid in your analysis (hint: functions can be very useful for creating plots)\n",
    "- Regression and/or analysis using GIS tools \n",
    "- Word document with data description, brief explanation of why certain analyses or relationships were examined, and brief results/conclusions. Results do not have to be significant in any way, but note how/why you decided they were or were not. Also include plots (with figure numbers and captions). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Due December 9, 2021, by 5 pm. We *cannot accept late assignments*, as we need to turn in grades soon after the exam period ends on December 10. Reach out to us early if you are having issues or have questions!** "

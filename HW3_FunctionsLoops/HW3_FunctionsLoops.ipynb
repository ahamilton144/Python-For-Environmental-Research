    "# Homework 3: Conditions, loops, and functions\n",
    "ENVR 890-010: Python for Environmental Research, Fall 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "By Rosa Cuppari. Material adapted from Andrew Hamilton and Greg Characklis. \n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "For this assignment, we will build a model simulating the operation of a simple reservoir, building off the ideas presented in the decision tree in class. This time, we have a slightly more complex reservoir operations model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Due date: Sep. 4, before class**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation model will work as follows over the course of 365 days (see next cell for a visual representation) and is based on a simple mass balance model: water stored (S) during a given day is equal to the water stored the day before plus any inflows (i) minus water released to meet demands (q) and minus water spilled because the reservoir was too full (w). To simulate this, we will: \n",
    "1. Measure the water stored in the reservoir at time t-1 ($S_{t-1}$) and forecast inflows at time t ($i_t$)\n",
    "1. If $S_{t-1}$+$i_t$ is greater than the maximum storage capacity, then spill the difference\n",
    "    1. Forecast demand for water at time t ($q_t$) based on the season \n",
    "    1. If $q_t$ is less than or equal to $S_t$ (which is equal to the lesser of maximum capacity or $S_{t-1}$+$i_t$), release $q_t$ and\n",
    "    1. Else, release $S_t$\n",
    "    1. Update $S_t$ to reflect any water released to meet demands\n",
    "1. Else, don't spill water \n",
    "    1. Forecast demand for water at time t ($q_t$) based on the season \n",
    "    1. If $q_t$ is less than or equal to $S_t$, release $q_t$ and\n",
    "    1. Else, release $S_t$\n",
    "    1. Update $S_t$ to reflect any water released to meet demands\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume our reservoir is full at the start of our for loop. At each iteration, storage ($S_t$) is equal to storage in the previous step ($S_(t-1)$) plus inflows ($i_t$) minus releases ($q_t$) and spill ($w_t$). We know that the reservoir has a maximum storage capacity of 5000 acre-feet. We also know that how much water is being demanded during each day. Demand will be a random number between 500 and 2500 acre-feet, and inflows will similarly vary. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will set the starting variables, import modules, and create a skeleton for the function. **Your job will be to create a function that can take the starting amount of storage, iterations (how many days to run the loop for), and inputs of inflow and demand and return a dataframe with each iteration's storage level, spills, and releases. The for loop should also print a statment whenever demand is greater than storage, indicating during which iteration this happens. All incomplete blocks are referenced with \"## TODO\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't forget to save a new copy of this notebook with your last name, and resave when you are finished.**"

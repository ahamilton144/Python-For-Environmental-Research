    "1. Fill in the answers to each question using one or more new cells. Feel free to use markdown cells, code cells, or a mix of the two, depending on the nature of the question. Refer to the top of Lecture 1 (and the cited reference) for some tips on how to create and alter different types of cells.\n",
    "1. After finishing, save the notebook (``Ctrl`` + ``s``, so that it says \"Last Checkpoint: a few seconds ago (autosaved)\" rather than \"...(unsaved changes)\" at the top of the page next to the Notebook's name)"

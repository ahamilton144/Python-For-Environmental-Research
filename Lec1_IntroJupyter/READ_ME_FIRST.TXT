The file ending ".ipynb" designates a Jupyter Notebook. You will need to install Python and Jupyter Notebook software before you can open the file. For instructions of how to download the software, see the online version of the course repository (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ahamilton144/Python-For-Environmental-Research/F21) and navigate to "Lec1_IntroJupyter/Lec1_IntroJupyter.ipynb". This lecture contains instructions at the end for installing software. Once you have done that, you should be able to work with Notebook files directly on your own computer.

    "### Instructions\n",
    "For this assignment, we will build a model simulating the operation of a simple reservoir, building off the ideas presented in the decision tree in class. This time, we have a slightly more complex reservoir operations model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Due date: Sep. 4, before class**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation model will work as follows over the course of 365 days (see next cell for a visual representation):\n",
    "1. Measure the water stored in the reservoir at time t-1 ($S_{t-1}$) and forecast inflows at time t ($i_t$)\n",
    "1. If $S_{t-1}$+$i_t$ is greater than the maximum storage capacity, then spill the difference\n",
    "    1. Forecast demand for water at time t ($q_t$) based on the season \n",
    "    1. If $q_t$ is less than or equal to $S_t$ (which is equal to the lesser of maximum capacity or $S_{t-1}$+$i_t$), release $q_t$ and\n",
    "    1. Else, release $S_t$\n",
    "    1. Update $S_t$ to reflect any water released to meet demands\n",
    "1. Else, don't spill water \n",
    "    1. Forecast demand for water at time t ($q_t$) based on the season \n",
    "    1. If $q_t$ is less than or equal to $S_t$, release $q_t$ and\n",
    "    1. Else, release $S_t$\n",
    "    1. Update $S_t$ to reflect any water released to meet demands\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume our reservoir is full at the start of our for loop. At each iteration, storage ($S_t$) is equal to storage in the previous step ($S_(t-1)$) plus inflows ($i_t$) minus releases ($q_t$) and spill ($w_t$). We know that the reservoir has a maximum storage capacity of 10000 acre-feet. We also know that how much water is being demanded during each day. Demand will be a random number between 500 and 2500 acre-feet, and inflows will similarly vary. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will set the starting variables, import modules, and create a skeleton for the function. **Your job will be to create a function that can take the starting amount of storage, iterations (how many days to run the loop for), and inputs of inflow and demand and return a dataframe with each iteration's storage level, spills, and releases. The for loop should also print a statment whenever demand is greater than storage, indicating during which iteration this happens. All incomplete blocks are referenced with \"## TODO\".**\n",

    "**Don't forget to save a new copy of this notebook with your last name, and resave when you are finished.**"
